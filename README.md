## Getting started
This code was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and requires a CUDA-capable GPU.

1. Clone repository and submodules
    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/vye16/slahmr.git
    ```
    or initialize submodules if already cloned
    ```
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2. Set up conda environment. Run 
    ```
    source install.sh
    ```

    <details>
        <summary>We also include the following steps for trouble-shooting.</summary>

    * Create environment
        ```
        conda env create -f env.yaml
        conda activate slahmr
        ```
        We use PyTorch 1.13.0 with CUDA 11.7. Please modify according to your setup; we've tested successfully for PyTorch 1.11 as well.
        We've also included `env_build.yaml` to speed up installation using already-solved dependencies, though it might not be compatible with your CUDA driver.

    * Install current source repo
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```

    * Install ViTPose
        ```
        pip install -v -e third-party/PHALP_plus/ViTPose
        ```

    * Install DROID-SLAM (will take a while)
        ```
        cd third-party/DROID-SLAM
        python setup.py install
        ```
    </details>

3. Download models from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GXAd-45GzGYNENKgQxFQ4PHrBp8wDRlW/view?usp=sharing). Run
    ```
    ./download_models.sh
    ```
    or
    ```
    gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GXAd-45GzGYNENKgQxFQ4PHrBp8wDRlW
    unzip -q slahmr_dependencies.zip
    rm slahmr_dependencies.zip
    ```

    All models and checkpoints should have been unpacked in `_DATA`.


## Fitting to an RGB video:
For a custom video, you can edit the config file: `slahmr/confs/data/video.yaml`.
Then, from the `slahmr` directory, you can run:
```
python run_opt.py data=video run_opt=True run_vis=True
```

We use hydra to launch experiments, and all parameters can be found in `slahmr/confs/config.yaml`.
If you would like to update any aspect of logging or optimization tuning, update the relevant config files.

By default, we will log each run to `outputs/video-val/<DATE>/<VIDEO_NAME>`.
Each stage of optimization will produce a separate subdirectory, each of which will contain outputs saved throughout the optimization
and rendered videos of the final result for that stage of optimization.
The `motion_chunks` directory contains the outputs of the final stage of optimization,
`root_fit` and `smooth_fit` contain outputs of short, intermediate stages of optimization,
and `init` contains the initialized outputs before optimization.

We've provided a `run_vis.py` script for running visualization from logs after optimization.
From the `slahmr` directory, run
```
python run_vis.py --log_root <LOG_ROOT>
```
and it will visualize all log subdirectories in `<LOG_ROOT>`.
Each output npz file will contain the SMPL parameters for all optimized people, the camera intrinsics and extrinsics.
The `motion_chunks` output will contain additional predictions from the motion prior.
Please see `run_vis.py` for how to extract the people meshes from the output parameters.


## Fitting to specific datasets:
We provide configurations for dataset formats in `slahmr/confs/data`:
1. Posetrack in `slahmr/confs/data/posetrack.yaml`
2. Egobody in `slahmr/confs/data/egobody.yaml`
3. 3DPW in `slahmr/confs/data/3dpw.yaml`
4. DAVIS in `slahmr/confs/data/davis.yaml`
5. Custom video in `slahmr/confs/data/video.yaml`

**Please make sure to update all paths to data in the config files.**

We include tools to both process existing datasets we evaluated on in the paper, and to process custom data and videos.
We include experiments from the paper on the Egobody, Posetrack, and 3DPW datasets.

If you want to run on a large number of videos, or if you want to select specific people tracks for optimization,
we recommend preprocesing in advance. 
For a single downloaded video, there is no need to run preprocessing in advance.

From the `slahmr/preproc` directory, run PHALP on all your sequences
```
python launch_phalp.py --type <DATASET_TYPE> --root <DATASET_ROOT> --split <DATASET_SPLIT> --gpus <GPUS>
```
and run DROID-SLAM on all your sequences
```
python launch_slam.py --type <DATASET_TYPE> --root <DATASET_ROOT> --split <DATASET_SPLIT> --gpus <GPUS>
```
You can also update the paths to datasets in `slahmr/preproc/datasets.py` for repeated use.

Then, from the `slahmr` directory,
```
python run_opt.py data=<DATA_CFG> run_opt=True run_vis=True
```

We've provided a helper script `launch.py` for launching many optimization jobs in parallel.
You can specify job-specific arguments with a job spec file, such as the example files in `job_specs`,
and batch-specific arguments shared across all jobs as
```
python launch.py --gpus 1 2 -f job_specs/pt_val_shots.txt -s data=posetrack exp_name=posetrack_val
```

## Evaluation on 3D datasets
After launching and completing optimization on either the Egobody or 3DPW datasets,
you can evaluate the outputs with scripts in the `eval` directory.
Before running, please update `EGOBODY_ROOT` and `TDPW_ROOT` in `eval/tools.py`.
Then, run
```
python run_eval.py -d <DSET_TYPE> -i <RES_ROOT> -f <JOB_FILE>
```
where `<JOB_FILE>` is the same job file used to launch all optimization runs.

In addition you can get an interactive visualization of the optimization procedure and the final output using [Rerun](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun) with `python run_rerun_vis.py --log_root <LOG_DIR>`.
